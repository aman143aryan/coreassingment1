The temples in India have always been special for the belief they have in the followers of this religion. South India is known for its temples all around the world. The temple cities of India, as they are fondly called, are known for its marvelous architecture and high religious beliefs. We recently happened to be on a The South India Temple Tour visiting some of the famous temples in the temple cities of South India. The journey, a combination of a road and rail, took us through famous cities like 6- days itinerary of South India was focused on keeping it religious with other attractions that each city had to offer. We will take you on a city-wise journey of this South India trip and would talk about the famous temples of South India, the one that we visited and few that we missed. We will also talk about other mythological significance of various towns in South India and the roles that they played especially in Ramayana. So, let's begin.
